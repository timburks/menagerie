    The AWS Migration Hub API methods help to obtain server and application migration status and integrate your resource-specific migration tool by providing a programmatic interface to Migration Hub.

    Remember that you must set your AWS Migration Hub home region before you call any of these APIs, or a `HomeRegionNotSetException` error will be returned. Also, you must make the API calls while in your home region.
