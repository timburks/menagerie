    AWS Signer is a fully managed code signing service to help you ensure the trust and integrity of your code.

    AWS Signer supports the following applications:

    With _code signing for AWS Lambda_, you can sign AWS Lambda deployment packages. Integrated support is provided for Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS CloudTrail. In order to sign code, you create a signing profile and then use Signer to sign Lambda zip files in S3.

    With _code signing for IoT_, you can sign code for any IoT device that is supported by AWS. IoT code signing is available for [Amazon FreeRTOS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/) and [AWS IoT Device Management](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/), and is integrated with [AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/). In order to sign code, you import a third-party code signing certificate using ACM, and use that to sign updates in Amazon FreeRTOS and AWS IoT Device Management.

    For more information about AWS Signer, see the [AWS Signer Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html).
