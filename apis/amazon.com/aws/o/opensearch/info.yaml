    Use the Amazon OpenSearch Service configuration API to create, configure, and manage OpenSearch Service domains.

    For sample code that uses the configuration API, see the [_Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer Guide_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/opensearch-configuration-samples.html). The guide also contains [sample code](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/request-signing.html) for sending signed HTTP requests to the OpenSearch APIs. The endpoint for configuration service requests is Region specific: es. _region_.amazonaws.com. For example, es.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. For a current list of supported Regions and endpoints, see [Amazon Web Services service endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#service-regions).
