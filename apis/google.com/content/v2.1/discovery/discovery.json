If a promotion is applied to more than 1 offerId, divide the discount value by the number of affected offers to determine how much discount to apply to each offerId. Examples: 1. To calculate price paid by the customer for a single line item including the discount: For each promotion, subtract the `LineItems[].adjustments[].priceAdjustment.value` amount from the `LineItems[].Price.value`. 2. To calculate price paid by the customer for a single line item including the discount in case of multiple quantity: For each promotion, divide the `LineItems[].adjustments[].priceAdjustment.value` by the quantity of products then subtract the resulting value from the `LineItems[].Product.Price.value` for each quantity item. Only 1 promotion can be applied to an offerId in a given order. To refund an item which had a promotion applied to it, make sure to refund the amount after first subtracting the promotion discount from the item price. More details about the program are here."
