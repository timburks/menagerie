A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`.

The only currently supported attribute is `x-goog-version`, which you can use to change the format of the pushed message. This attribute indicates the version of the data expected by the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message (i.e., its fields and metadata). If not present during the `CreateSubscription` call, it will default to the version of the Pub/Sub API used to make such call. If not present in a `ModifyPushConfig` call, its value will not be changed. `GetSubscription` calls will always return a valid version, even if the subscription was created without this attribute. The only supported values for the `x-goog-version` attribute are: * `v1beta1`: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API. * `v1` or `v1beta2`: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.
