The response would have two empty replies, the reply to the third request, and another empty reply, in that order.

The glyph format contains one or more placeholders, and these placeholders are replaced with the appropriate values depending on the glyph_type or glyph_symbol. The placeholders follow the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Furthermore, placeholders can have prefixes and suffixes. Thus, the glyph format follows the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Note that the prefix and suffix are optional and can be arbitrary strings. For example, the glyph format `%0.` indicates that the rendered glyph will replace the placeholder with the corresponding glyph for nesting level 0 followed by a period as the suffix. So a list with a glyph type of UPPER_ALPHA and glyph format `%0.` at nesting level 0 will result in a list with rendered glyphs `A.` `B.` `C.` The glyph format can contain placeholders for the current nesting level as well as placeholders for parent nesting levels. For example, a list can have a glyph format of `%0.` at nesting level 0 and a glyph format of `%0.%1.` at nesting level 1. Assuming both nesting levels have DECIMAL glyph types, this would result in a list with rendered glyphs `1.` `2.` ` 2.1.` ` 2.2.` `3.` For nesting levels that are ordered, the string that replaces a placeholder in the glyph format for a particular paragraph depends on the paragraph's order within the list."
