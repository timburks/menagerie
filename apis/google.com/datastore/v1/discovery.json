For more information about Cloud Storage namespace paths, see [Object name considerations](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming#object-considerations). The resulting files will be nested deeper than the specified URL prefix. The final output URL will be provided in the google.datastore.admin.v1.ExportEntitiesResponse.output_url field. That value should be used for subsequent ImportEntities operations.
