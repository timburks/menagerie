When you set threshold rules, you must also enable at least one of the email notification options, either using the default IAM recipients or Cloud Monitoring email notification channels. To use Pub/Sub topics with budgets, you must do the following: 1. Create the Pub/Sub topic before connecting it to your budget. For guidance, see [Manage programmatic budget alert notifications](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications). 2. Grant the API caller the `pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy` permission on the Pub/Sub topic. If not set, the API call fails with PERMISSION_DENIED.
