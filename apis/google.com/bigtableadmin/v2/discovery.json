Some examples of using filters are: * `name:\"exact\"` --\u003e The backup's name is the string \"exact\". * `name:howl` --\u003e The backup's name contains the string \"howl\". * `source_table:prod` --\u003e The source_table's name contains the string \"prod\". * `state:CREATING` --\u003e The backup is pending creation. * `state:READY` --\u003e The backup is fully created and ready for use. * `(name:howl) AND (start_time \u003c \\\"2018-03-28T14:50:00Z\\\")` --\u003e The backup name contains the string \"howl\" and start_time of the backup is before 2018-03-28T14:50:00Z. * `size_bytes \u003e 10000000000` --\u003e The backup's size is greater than 10GB",
