Fields are appended with the same sort direction as the last order specified, or 'ASCENDING' if no order was specified. For example: * `ORDER BY a` becomes `ORDER BY a ASC, __name__ ASC` * `ORDER BY a DESC` becomes `ORDER BY a DESC, __name__ DESC` * `WHERE a \u003e 1` becomes `WHERE a \u003e 1 ORDER BY a ASC, __name__ ASC` * `WHERE __name__ \u003e ...

Cursors can reference either the full ordering or a prefix of the location, though it cannot reference more fields than what are in the provided `ORDER BY`. Continuing off the example above, attaching the following start cursors will have varying impact: - `START BEFORE (2, /k/123)`: start the query right before `a = 1 AND b \u003e 2 AND __name__ \u003e /k/123`. - `START AFTER (10)`: start the query right after `a = 1 AND b \u003e 10`. Unlike `OFFSET` which requires scanning over the first N results to skip, a start cursor allows the query to begin at a logical position.
