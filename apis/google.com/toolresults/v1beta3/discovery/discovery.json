Currently, this creates a single resource: a Google Cloud Storage bucket, to be used as the default bucket for this project. The bucket is created in an FTL-own storage project. Except for in rare cases, calling this method in parallel from multiple clients will only create a single bucket. In order to avoid unnecessary storage charges, the bucket is configured to automatically delete objects older than 90 days. The bucket is created with the following permissions: - Owner access for owners of central storage project (FTL-owned) - Writer access for owners/editors of customer project - Reader access for viewers of customer project The default ACL on objects created in the bucket is: - Owner access for owners of central storage project - Reader access for owners/editors/viewers of customer project See Google Cloud Storage documentation for more details. If there is already a default bucket set and the project can access the bucket, this call does nothing. However, if the project doesn't have the permission to access the bucket or the bucket is deleted, a new bucket will be created.

The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading \".\" is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows: * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a google.protobuf.Type value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific semantics."

      "description": " `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a URL that describes the type of the serialized message. Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type. Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++. Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) { ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java. Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python. foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo) ... Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo := &pb.Foo{...} any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo) ... foo := &pb.Foo{} if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil { ... } The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use 'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/' in the type URL, for example \"foo.bar.com/x/y.z\" will yield type name \"y.z\". # JSON The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\", \"firstName\": , \"lastName\": } If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field. Example (for message google.protobuf.Duration): { \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\", \"value\": \"1.212s\" }",
