For example, if the object is the Eiffel Tower, in its local coordinate system the object might be laid out such that the base of the tower is on the YZ plane and the tip of the tower is towards positive X. In this case this quaternion would specify a rotation (of 90 degrees about the Z axis) such that in the presentation space the base of the tower is aligned with the XZ plane, and the tip of the tower lies towards +Y.
