  displayName: Amazon EventBridge Pipes
  description: Amazon EventBridge Pipes connects event sources to targets. Pipes reduces the need for specialized knowledge and integration code when developing event driven architectures. This helps ensures consistency across your companyâ€™s applications. With Pipes, the target can be any available EventBridge target. To set up a pipe, you select the event source, add optional event filtering, define optional enrichment, and select the target for the event data.
