    Amazon WorkSpaces Service

    Amazon WorkSpaces enables you to provision virtual, cloud-based Microsoft Windows or Amazon Linux desktops for your users, known as _WorkSpaces_. WorkSpaces eliminates the need to procure and deploy hardware or install complex software. You can quickly add or remove users as your needs change. Users can access their virtual desktops from multiple devices or web browsers.

    This API Reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types, parameters, and errors of the WorkSpaces service. For more information about the supported Amazon Web Services Regions, endpoints, and service quotas of the Amazon WorkSpaces service, see [WorkSpaces endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/wsp.html) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

    You can also manage your WorkSpaces resources using the WorkSpaces console, Command Line Interface (CLI), and SDKs.
