  description: |-
    The Identity Store service used by AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) provides a single place to retrieve all of your identities (users and groups). For more information, see the [IAM Identity Center User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html).

    ```
     <note> <p>Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the <code>sso</code> and <code>identitystore</code> API namespaces will continue to retain their original name for backward compatibility purposes. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed">IAM Identity Center rename</a>.</p> </note> <p>This reference guide describes the identity store operations that you can call programatically and includes detailed information on data types and errors.</p>
